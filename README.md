Rate-limit methods and publications. Lightweight. Simple.

All code is ~200 lines and includes a full registry class to handle register and running the rate limiter.

## Install and import

```bash
$ meteor add leaonline:ratelimit-factory
```

Then import the specific functions via

```javascript
import { 
  runRateLimiter,
  rateLimitMethod,
  rateLimitMethods,
  rateLimitPublication,
  rateLimitPublications, 
  rateLimitAccounts } from 'meteor/leaonline:ratelimit-factory'
```

You can simply omit the functions you don't need.

## Usage

You can use these functions to rate limit all Methods and Publications on your Meteor backend.
After you have added all Methods/Publications, you can execute the rate limier using `runRateLimiter`
and pass a callback function which is executed on limit exceeded.

For a detailed usage, you can lookup the [API documentation](./API.md)
